            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Fashion_Week" target="_blank">New York Fashion Week</a> is famous for its electric atmosphere, but let's be honest: beneath the fun and the fashion, it can be incredibly overwhelming for a first-timer trying to find their footing.

            <h2>Getting Tickets & Picking the Shows</h2>
        </div>

            <p>If you run in the right circles or strike a bit of luck, you might find yourself with a coveted invite, completely <em>sans</em> the price tag. But I was not so lucky or connected my first couple seasons, so I had to learn the ropes of the ticketed experience the hard way. Now, I want to save you the trouble. The process begins with making a game plan by remembering the golden rule: set a budget. You want to remember the fashion, not the financial stress, so determine what you are comfortable spending first. Compare the ticket tier prices, prioritize your absolute 'must-sees' versus the 'nice-to-haves,' and lock them in. Once you hit that purchase button, the hard work is done, and the anticipation can truly begin.</p>

            <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>
        </div>

            <p>When planning your looks, the most important advice I can give is to stay true to your own sense of style. If you dress for someone else, you'll spend the day fidgeting and feeling out of place, which inevitably kills your vibe. This week is about celebrating creativity, so use your outfit to express who <em>you</em> are while you soak in what the designers are expressing on the catwalk. Remember to also be practical: you will be standing, walking, and waiting all day long. Your choice of footwear will be a make-or-break factor for your experience. You obviously want to look chic, but be sure to find that sweet spot between high fashion and high comfort - your feet will thank you later.</p>
